# LRNL-bench (to come)
The Logical Reasoning over Natural Language as Knowledge Representation Benchmark (LRNL-bench) is a *collaborative* benchmark intended to promote a comprehensive evaluation on the three sub-reasoning aspects of logical reasoning (the three aspects are deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning).

Description of the datasets and developement of this research field can be found on our associated survey paper: [Logical Reasoning over Natural Language as Knowledge Representation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12023.pdf)
